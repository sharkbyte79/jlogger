# simplelogger
**IN PROGRESS**

A simple logging package for Go, with basic functionality heavily inspired by Python's [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library.

Handling logs was largely ignored in my formal computer science education, so this was primarily written to learn more about logging as a practice.
